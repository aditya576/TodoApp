A simple todo list web app where you can add important things that you need to do 
throughout the day, delete any todo, update a todo and mark a todo as completed too.
You can even reset all the todos when you are done forr the day.

Functionalities I wasn't able to add-

* Load the previous state upon refresh(used localStorage for that, but didn't work for some reason)
* Could append the completed items, but not remove it from it's initial location.

Would definitely learn and try to add these functionalities asap.
