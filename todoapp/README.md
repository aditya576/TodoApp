# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.


A simple todo list web app where you can add important things that you need to do 
throughout the day, delete any todo, update a todo and mark a todo as completed too.
You can even reset all the todos when you are done forr the day.

Things I wasn't able to do-

* Load the previous state upon refresh(used localStorage for that, but didn't work for some reason)
* Could append the completed items, but not remove it from it's initial location.

Would definitely love to rectify these things in the next few days.
